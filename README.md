Simple Naive Bayes Text Classifier
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Naive Bayes text classifier, using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The classifier is trained using a text dataset, processes the data through a TF-IDF Vectorizer, and evaluates the model using confusion matrices to visualize its performance.

Overview
The project demonstrates how to classify text data using a Naive Bayes classifier. The classifier uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes model, which is well-suited for text classification tasks such as spam detection and topic categorization.

Dataset
Currently, this project uses the 20 Newsgroups dataset, a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents divided into 20 categories. The current categories can be expanded to create a more robust model for real-world applications.

Current Categories in the 20 Newsgroups dataset:

alt.atheism
comp.graphics
comp.os.ms-windows.misc
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware
comp.sys.mac.hardware
comp.windows.x
misc.forsale
rec.autos
rec.motorcycles
rec.sport.baseball
rec.sport.hockey
sci.crypt
sci.electronics
sci.med
sci.space
soc.religion.christian
talk.politics.guns
talk.politics.mideast
talk.politics.misc
talk.religion.misc
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/naive-bayes-text-classifier.git
2. Install Dependencies
Use pip to install the required dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
If you do not have a requirements.txt, you can manually install the dependencies:

bash

pip install scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy
Usage
Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
To begin, import the necessary libraries:

python

from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
Step 2: Load and Split Dataset
Load the 20 Newsgroups dataset and split it into training and testing sets:

python

newsgroups = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all')
Step 3: Create the Naive Bayes Model
Create a pipeline that combines the TF-IDF Vectorizer and the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier:

python

model = make_pipeline(TfidfVectorizer(), MultinomialNB())
Step 4: Train the Model
Train the model using the training data:

python

model.fit(newsgroups.data, newsgroups.target)
Step 5: Make Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data:

python

predicted = model.predict(newsgroups.data)
Step 6: Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix. Visualize the results with a heatmap:

python

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(newsgroups.target, predicted)
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('True')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()

seaborn: A library for enhanced data visualizations.
numpy: A fundamental package for numerical computations.
Improvements
1. Expanding Categories
Currently, the model uses the 20 Newsgroups dataset with predefined categories. However, it would be beneficial to expand the model to include more categories. This could be done by:

Collecting a broader set of labeled data (e.g., from Kaggle datasets or creating custom labels).
Adding categories like social media content, product reviews, or news articles, which would make the model more versatile in practical applications.
2. Text Preprocessing Enhancements
The model uses raw text with minimal preprocessing. Future work could focus on:

Removing stop words to improve performance.
Stemming and Lemmatization to normalize words.
Handling bigrams or trigrams for better feature extraction.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
The default parameters of the Naive Bayes model and TF-IDF vectorizer are used. However, tuning these parameters (like adjusting the alpha parameter in Naive Bayes or using ngram_range in TF-IDF) could improve classification accuracy.

4. Advanced Evaluation Metrics
Beyond confusion matrices, consider evaluating the model using:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for a more comprehensive evaluation.
Cross-validation to get a better estimate of model performance.
5. Model Expansion
While Naive Bayes is a good baseline for text classification, you could try more advanced models such as:

Support Vector Machines (SVM) for text classification.
Deep Learning-based models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for handling more complex text data.

Notes on Areas for Improvement:
Category Expansion: Expanding categories would allow the model to generalize better in practical applications. You could also include categories such as "technology", "politics", "sports", or even more domain-specific categories depending on your needs.
Preprocessing: Text data often requires cleaning before it can be used to train a model. Adding preprocessing steps, such as stemming and lemmatization, will likely improve your model's performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different values for hyperparameters (e.g., TF-IDF n-grams or Naive Bayes smoothing) could optimize performance.
Evaluation Metrics: The current evaluation only uses the confusion matrix. Using a more extensive set of evaluation metrics can help gauge the modelâ€™s overall quality.
